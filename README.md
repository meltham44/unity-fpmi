# unity-fpmi
> Developed for use with a programming project developed for MEng Cyber Security with Digital Forensics Level 6 - Team Project module.

This is a simple Unity project which features a first person player. The movement can be controlled using the WASD or arrow keys and the direction the player is facing in can be controlled using the mouse. The player is also able to interact with objects using the E key or the left mouse button, for example the cube present in the scene included in the project will move when interacted with.

This movement and interaction base was used as part of a wider project, which can be played at https://enigmatrail.xyz
